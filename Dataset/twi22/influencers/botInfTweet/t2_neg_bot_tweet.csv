u69765978,"@geostylegeo @john_traphagan Just like China with Taiwan, Russia has no appetite outside of its zone of former Russian Empire, but whatever was within it - is a potential target and thus vulnerable. US went to Iraq, Libya, Syria and Vietnam with no sanctions against it, and Putin sees it as double standard."
u69765978,"@geostylegeo @john_traphagan As somebody who knows a bit about Russia and lived 19 years in USSR I concur - if, of course, he survives his circle (I'm sure he's paranoid anxious and afraid of everyone around him). If that military experiment will make his billionaires poorer,there will be a riot against him."
u69765978,"@Derek_Prowse @geostylegeo It was already tried in Russia with Yeltsin, and then ... Yeltsin said ""I'm tired, I'm leaving"" and suggested Putin to be the new tzar. There were never smart and visionary leaders in Russia."
u69765978,"@geostylegeo The way Putin sees it it's a fight not between him and Ukraine (he doesn't see Ukraine as an independent country, but as a puppet regime installed by US), but between him and ""the forces of evil"" that US and NATO represent. It's up to China-if they refuse to supply him, it's over"
u69765978,"@VegasVisions The big problem with Russian people they need a shepherd, they're not entrepreneurial and not risk takers - for too long propaganda of USSR and Putin after 9 years of back and forth in 1990s - they were told their way is ""special"", ""unique"", is a ""mission"" - bleak perspective."
u69765978,"@wa_waters @geostylegeo People of Russia that still support his ""campaign"" are naively waiting for low hanging fruits he promised - they'll never see the promised results and you can't pull it forever, even as you're a dictator - Ceau»ôescu was killed, so Putin is playing same game."
u69765978,"@geostylegeo We know Venezuela - think of Russia as big Venezuela now, potentially even worse."
u69765978,"@geostylegeo It will take a while for Russians to learn that ""spirituality"" and ""love of god"" do not fill the fridge, but it's going to be nightmare for a while for Russians - money is gone, businesses are gone, the only things left are ""traditional"" low quality, not competitive industries."
u69765978,@geostylegeo So the way it's going now his own oligarchs will get poorer and will eventually kill him - he f.cked up 140 millions of Russians and they will not wait forever. Back to USSR will not last long - people will get tired of isolation and poverty and there will be an uprising.
u69765978,"@geostylegeo I think he ran out of ideas how to intimidate his own people and the neighboring countries so he came up with this crazy idea of uniting Russians in the face of imaginary ""enemy"" - he surely didn't anticipate the result, he thought it will be swift triumph - he's in deadlock now."
u69765978,"@russ_hjelm This was obvious overreaction and prices must go down, with or without Russia."
u69765978,"@ApsuaRitsa Yeah, and then they ask why people of Russia turned to Putin? Because Europe offered them to kiss the lock of their gates. There was a decade of chaos and anarchy in Russia in 90s - and nobody wanted to help Russia when there was a window of opportunity, now it's too late."

u3284321905,"@__Common__Man__ @ArunRajGopalan @nisheethsharan Out of the data you provided on students in ukraine on two are potential world superpower list china and india which means they have more power, relations, money, etc. so they could be able to access situations and evacuate more efficiently than all the countries in that list."
u3284321905,@nisheethsharan For all those who still think that it is not a country's responsibility to rescue their citizens from abroad during emergency and other countries are not rescueing students from ukraine...I urge them to visit the embassy twitter handles of different countries.
u3284321905,"@__Common__Man__ @ArunRajGopalan @nisheethsharan No data is wrong. You are talking about students in ukraine from different countries, the article was showing indians as students in different countries. Both are correct."

u3284321905,@sandyahuja9 @nisheethsharan Have you read the advisory mostly those before 15 feb?? And the students were not ignorant but concerned about their future. And do you know flights to India from Ukraine were banned before 17 Feb? And what if they came and war wouldn't have happened?

If for any reason far wouldn't have happened and they would have left...the would the government help the students to deal with uni??
u3284321905,"@SRS17SG @mayurjoshi999 @nisheethsharan @IndiainUkraine Also it was question of career as uni has compulsory offline and has not clarified anything till the attack happened.

So students are not the cause of delay."

u884851327251222532,The repercussions of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine are harming China‚Äôs interests. This may be a moment to probe whether Beijing is capable of reorientation to put daylight between its interests and Russia‚Äôs recklessness. A few brief thoughts: https://t.co/fQ3XTqyGOG
u884851327251222532,"Thank you @risk_podcast for an opportunity to share thoughts on evaluating risk for Taiwan, supply chains, and geopolitics in Asia as crisis unfolds in Ukraine. 

https://t.co/VF8tEFZVQA"
u884851327251222532,"4/ China just left Russia hanging in wind at UN Security Council, leaving Russia alone to veto resolution. Credit to US &amp; other diplomats. It's a reminder that China-Russia relationship remains fluid, it isn't predestined and fixed. Premature to declare diplomacy w/PRC dead. END."
u884851327251222532,3/ It should not come as surprise that Beijing rebuffed US urgings of it to intervene with Moscow. That isn‚Äôt how China-Russia relationship works. This anticipable outcome should not discourage future efforts by US &amp; others to push China to reorient following Russia's invasion.
u884851327251222532,"1/ @ewong provides insight into US diplomatic efforts to urge China to play constructive role in averting conflict in Ukraine. He highlights how China not only tilted toward Russia, but also violated American trust in sharing US intelligence with Moscow.

u884851327251222532,"Sharing a few brief thoughts on lessons Taiwan might take away from events in Ukraine. 
https://t.co/o7mSTUiY64 via @BrookingsInst"
u884851327251222532,"@KanwalSibal The question is whether China's ability to achieve its ambitions will be enhanced by tying itself to Russia, and whether it is possible for outside powers (not just US) to influence how China evaluates costs/benefits of decision. I would prefer to test proposition. Others may not"
u884851327251222532,"10/ Xi isn‚Äôt going to change Putin‚Äôs calculus on Ukraine. The test will be how Beijing responds to events there. In the coming weeks, we likely will learn a lot about U.S.-China relations, and China‚Äôs view of its role in the world, for the coming years. END."
u884851327251222532,"9/ We may yet end up with China taking a head-down, all-in approach with Russia, but if we do, I hope it is because all efforts to forestall it were exhausted. Crises also present opportunities. US diplomacy should explore whether they can be realized."
u884851327251222532,"8/ It may also require credibly warning China that if it locks into order-challenging partnership with Russia, its relations with the West would be more strained. Calls also would grow louder in the US to view Taiwan as a strategic asset for dealing with an antagonistic China."
u884851327251222532,7/ Beijing needs to be helped toward realizing that going all-in on China-Russia rlnshp carries more risks than benefits. This may require efforts by other parties to signal to Beijing that a path remains open for China‚Äôs rise ‚Äì the rest of the world isn't determined to obstruct.
u884851327251222532,"6/ The goal would not be to seek to compel Beijing to break from Moscow. That is not happening. It would be to help Beijing reach its own judgment that its interests require it to begin a gradual, steady reorientation in the wake of a Russian invasion of Ukraine."
u884851327251222532,"5/ Now is the time for sharpening Beijing‚Äôs choices. This does not mean concessions or softening approach to PRC. Rather, it requires Beijing seeing a path remaining open for less hostile relations with West, and significant risks for being linked to Russia‚Äôs recklessness."
u884851327251222532,4/ Some may argue Beijing already made this choice. I would caution against assuming such pre-destiny. It's not in US interest for China to conclude it has no alternative but to tether itself fully to Russia. China-Russia relations now are unnaturally close by historic standards.
u884851327251222532,"3/ If Russia starts war and PRC allows itself to become seen as a witting enabler, Beijing risks finding itself aligned with weakest other major power and hastening the process of hedging by other key actors (EU, UK, India, Japan, Australia, etc.). See: https://t.co/4CcoW0BYkX"
u884851327251222532,"2/ Fixating on US-China-Russia triangle may be the wrong lens for examining events. If there is war in Ukraine, and if China actively attempts to shield Russia from global condemnation, then China may spur a self-harming solidification of blocs."
u884851327251222532,"1/ Debates over the US-China-Russia triangle are likely to intensify in the coming weeks. Russia‚Äôs aggression toward Ukraine will provide the spark, but lingering US frustration at the current strategic geometry ‚Äì 50 years after Nixon‚Äôs visit to China ‚Äì will add fuel to debates."

u884851327251222532,"2/ By these measures, the US response to events in Ukraine should be viewed as fairly reassuring thus far to America's partners in the Indo-Pacific. The US has maintained an active agenda in the region and alliance unity has held pretty firm in response to Russian pressure."
u884851327251222532,1/ I expect two of the main measures Beijing (and others in Asia) will use to evaluate US responses to Ukraine are: (1) Will US get distracted &amp; deprioritize Asia? (2) Will alliance unity for responding to Russia hold? https://t.co/P53IinlNzu via @bpolitics @PeterMartin_PCM
u884851327251222532,"Kudos to @SecBlinken for a productive trip against backdrop of escalating tensions in Ukraine. The trip sends an important signal of prioritization on the region, a key factor in how countries will evaluate America's commitment and staying power in Asia.

u884851327251222532,"This joint statement is an insight into the ambitions and anxieties that animate Sino-Russian relations. 

The two sides declared their bilateral relations are ""superior to political and military alliances of the Cold War era.""  https://t.co/4npXl0gaRJ via @KremlinRussia_E"
u884851327251222532,"9/ In other words, China is in a diplomatic jam. It would face difficulties and unwelcome turbulence from a conflict in Ukraine, but at the same time it wants to preserve strong relations with Russia and it does not want to do the U.S. any favors. END."
u884851327251222532,"8/ China also maintains good relations with Ukraine. Xi sent congratulatory letter to Zelensky in January. Ukraine is an important supplier of foodstuffs and other equipment to China, and China is Ukraine's top trading partner. 
https://t.co/k8YY7hfXtI"
u884851327251222532,"7/ A Russian invasion also could generate negative consequences for Chinese hi-tech companies, particularly if Russia gets designated with foreign direct product rule and Chinese firms are swept up in US secondary sanctions and lose access to Western equipment and investment."
u884851327251222532,"6/ A Russian invasion likely would not do Beijing any favors on Taiwan. 

Conversely, it could cause the US to show greater strength in the Pacific so that China doesn‚Äôt draw any wrong lessons from Putin‚Äôs incursion, perhaps a bit akin to events at start of Korean War."
u884851327251222532,"5/ Chinese officials also recognize that Beijing will be found guilty by association if Russia invades Ukraine after Putin's meeting with Xi. China will suffer significant reputational damage, especially in Europe and the US, for being seen as Russia's enabler."
u884851327251222532,"1/ As Xi and Putin prepare to meet in Beijing in the coming hours, I expect there will be a new wave of commentary about how Beijing might see benefits from a Russia-Ukraine conflict. I would advise interrogating those arguments a bit. Here's why:"
u884851327251222532,"3/ Yes, senior Chinese officials are parroting some of Moscow's favorite talking points, e.g., the U.S. and the West need to drop their ""Cold War mentality,"" US should not pursue security at Russia's expense, etc. Beijing will not do the US any favors. 

https://t.co/hL00kY5fxB"
u884851327251222532,"2/ Yes, a conflict in Ukraine could temporarily divert American strategic focus, reducing pressure on China. Yes, it would make Russia more dependent on China, thus giving Beijing greater leverage in its relations with Moscow."

u1465026528429981706,"@Mary_K_Leonard @_erod @sachiprecious A no fly zone means direct engagement with Russia - shooting down their planes, striking their SAMs, even on Russian ground. There's a reason both NATO and the Warsaw Pact avoided that for the entire Cold War - a high chance of escalating into nuclear holocaust."
u1465026528429981706,@JSethRhinehart1 @mtracey Sure: Israel fought defensive wars (and has given up territories conquered in those wars) while Russia is fighting an offensive war; Ukrainians don't go around Russia killing innocent children; Israel's military is far more competent than any of these.
u1465026528429981706,"@CostcoTote @LukeMelchior307 @mtracey Ukraine isn't doing it systemically as Hamas/Hezbollah do, let alone at the same scale, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's happening episodically, especially in zones under Azov military leadership. Indian students in Kharkiv complained about not being able to leave the city."
u1465026528429981706,"@mtracey Hamas and Hezbollah use civilian human shields all the time - this is well documented - and there's a pretty decent chance Ukraine is doing it as well, even if at a smaller scale."
u1465026528429981706,@zeptepispirit @KyivIndependent Nonsense. Ask what percentage thinks the US should go to war to Russia - which is what enforcing a no-fly zone means - and the percentage would be less than half of those 74%. People are just dumb and don't understand what it means.
u1465026528429981706,@junjy007 @KyivIndependent What? There's no no-fly zone whatsoever in Ukraine.
u1465026528429981706,"@suzanthony7 @Mary_K_Leonard @KyivIndependent No-fly zone means shooting down Russian jets, striking Russian SAMs, even on Russian ground - and starting a nuclear WW3. Stop being crazy."
u1465026528429981706,"@TheGreatGario @DogIsABot @RichardHanania They've been in Transnistria for years. There have been Russian troops stationed there in a peacekeeping mission for a long time. It just means they'll officialize it as an ""independent"" republic, which is inevitable anyway."
u1465026528429981706,"@Nadzieja07 @KyivIndependent @POTUS @UN Are you feeling suicidal? Do you know a no-fly zone implies shooting down Russian jets, striking Russia SAMs, even on Russia ground - so basically start WW3 and seriously risk a nuclear holocaust?"
u1465026528429981706,"@DaBoosterCali @KyivIndependent Me - &amp; I suppose most people who are educated on the issue and have no reasons to signal/lie. Unless we can impose a global embargo on Russian oil, then not buying Russian oil is ENTIRELY performative. It means nothing except slightly less efficient oil supply chains for everyone"
u1465026528429981706,"@JustynTyme_ @KyivIndependent And striking Russian SAMs. Genuinely insane - to be fair, most people supporting it don't really realize what it'd imply."
u1465026528429981706,"@DrUnicornPhD @notkavi @Jebisabigfatmes Nice try, but air strike Russia is there and a no-fly zone would require it."
u1465026528429981706,"@StatsLime @erich_luepke @notkavi @LucasOfSunshine You guys noticed the ""air strike Russia -33"" there, right? Enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would require striking GTAMs on Russian territory."
u1465026528429981706,"@mxPlzner @bernstein_judah @JonahDispatch You're a rube. This isn't about ""believing his fabrications"" or disbelieving. That's immaterial. Stop being a child. If Putin believes Russia needs a neutral buffer between them and NATO, then that matters and must be considered - no matter how much you shriek about it."
u1465026528429981706,@mxPlzner @bernstein_judah @JonahDispatch Really? Which question is disconnected from what's happening? Rival powers sharing a border? Role of neutral countries? One of the rationales for the invasion is literally Putin's desire to have a buffer between the Russian world and NATO. Escalation? Off-ramps?
u1465026528429981706,"@mllichti @tompoasting @mattyglesias So? Obviously, they'd use the opportunity, but it's all performative - everyone knows Georgia isn't joining the EU in years, even decades. It's still a pro-Russia government - there were literally demonstrations in the streets over it."
u1465026528429981706,@AstorAaron So the thesis - as I understand it - that these sanctions will send Russia into a comatose economic state to the point the state will struggle to resupply an army a few hundred kms away from its border after a few days is genuinely insane. Unless I'm missing something here.
u1465026528429981706,"@AstorAaron Back in the real world: JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs both forecast a 7% GDP contraction for Russia in 2022 with the current sanctions regime. This is large, but to put it in perspective, Spain GDP contracted -11% in 2020. UK almost 10%. Germany 5%."
u1465026528429981706,"@AstorAaron This isn't really different from what the Russian state media is showing and saying to Russians. Nexta is as biased and unreliable as those media. How exactly are resupplies going to be compromised? What is being compromised - fuel, food, what? It doesn't make any sense."
u1465026528429981706,"@minussr1 @AstorAaron Bohdan Khmelnytsky is a far less divisive and controversial figure in Ukraine than Bandera, but he's more strongly supported by people/regions who are less likely to show appreciation for Stepan Bandera and vice-versa."

u2864960801,There's no obvious 'off-ramp' for Russia because Europe has to meet US demands before any kind of negotiation with Russia can be contemplated. There's two forms of brinkmanship happening simultaneously here.

u2864960801,How countries that are protecting themselves from America's insidious influence should view neighbors who are still embracing it will become an increasingly important question. The issue won't be confined to Russia.
u2864960801,"Putin's right that Ukraine is being colonized and for the benefit of the US. This is just what 'liberal democracy', 'civil society', etc, are. There is nothing else to them. More and more countries will come to this point of view as the US declines. This is just the start."

u2864960801,"The current noise around Russia reminds of the now-forgotten period after Trump launched the trade war against China when all the foreign policy experts insisted that Xi was in trouble and was going to be deposed, which turned out to be a mass delusion produced by overconfidence."
u2864960801,I suspect the Office of Net Assessment style 'scientific study of cultural differences' does actually have influence in DC. They probably get briefed about the 'Russian mind' and the 'Chinese mind' before talking to Russians and Chinese. That would explain a lot.
u2864960801,The 'bringing Russia into the Western order' ship sailed long ago whereas China was still willingly accommodating US interests all the way into the Trump admin and even after the pointless trade war was launched. Going after China was a colossal own goal.
u2864960801,It's a testament to just how detached from reality public discourse is in the US that the obvious fact that the Russia-China partnership could have been avoided by not attacking China (the most recent and strategically pointless action to contribute to it) goes unmentioned.

u84052456,The worst part was not land grabbing. It was massacre against Chinese people. https://t.co/MzULnkZdmE  many Far East Russian towns had Chinese names before. But you can hardly see any Asian influence there. Vladivostok was Êµ∑ÂèÇÂ¥¥ a Chinese town
u84052456,I view the current alliance of Russia and China are more a way to protect against Western aggression for China. Not China likes Russia. Even with such alliance China government did not say they support this military action. Most Chinese people are really against it.
u84052456,You may think China supports Russia aggression. In fact deeply in our nation‚Äôs heart we are against it probably so much more than any other countries. Russia annexed over 150 square kilometers almost 3x of Ukraine land size in late 19 century. https://t.co/w4c7cTqVfA

u222696162,"Anyone watching images from Ukraine should condemn Putin's brutality. While Israel-haters exploit Ukrainian suffering to their advantage, the war should crystalize how differently the IDF handles wars against Hamas. Nothing like Russia, or even close to the propagandists' lies."

u222696162,@COLRICHARDKEMP One could argue that Ukraine doesn't have to win - it only has to survive long enough for the political cost to Putin to rise high enough to back him into a corner. Then he can claim victory and withdraw.
u222696162,I can't decide if the Ukraine war would prevent Hamas from starting a war with Israel (because Hamas would worry they wouldn't get their usual attention) or would goad Hamas into a war (to bring attention back to themselves). Probably the former.
