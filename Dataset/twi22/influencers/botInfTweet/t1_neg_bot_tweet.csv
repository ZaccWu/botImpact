u1465026528429981706,"@DeathAndSnaxes @mattyglesias Plus, it's very likely that a new endemic respiratory disease like covid will cause a permanent increase on deaths baseline. Just like all similar viruses do. The idea of having schools closing every year is just crazy."
u1465026528429981706,@EMC_Maine @PaulRieckhoff I also suspect a lot of these people wildly fantasize about being particularly vulnerable to covid. To vaccinated cohorts covid is substantially less severe than the flu - don't remember hearing about people living in reclusive isolation in flu seasons.
u1465026528429981706,"@JPoBTV You belived Biden when he said ""You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations"" while shrieking on twitter about DeSantis correctly saying ""vaccines don't prevent infection, vaxxed people are still getting infected"". 

And you're still a loyal bootlicker."
u1465026528429981706,"@JPoBTV Because covid waves will be seasonal, like respiratory virus, including other coronavirus, generally are. 

I'm just saying that's not the reason why covid is already endemic - it'd still be endemic even in the absence of seasonality."
u1465026528429981706,"@JPoBTV I understand you're filled with hatred and anger. DeSantis was right - vaccines don't stop infections. 

Biden lied to you when he said ""You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations"". And yet you're so broken you can't bring yourself to admit this."
u1465026528429981706,"@JPoBTV And FYI, an endemic disease doesn't need  the oubtreaks to be seasonal to be endemic (even though Covid will be). Malaria has non-seasonal outbreaks all the time - there's one, a village is wiped out. Still endemic."
u1465026528429981706,"@JPoBTV Just like you now understand DeSantis was right when he said vaccines don't prevent infection and you raged on tweet about it - while Biden was shrieking """"You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations"". 

Sorry you were conned. It happens to people like you."
u1465026528429981706,"@JPoBTV That's been true for covid for a year. You just don't understand what ""predictable"", ""stable"", etc, mean on this context. I mean, why do you think malaria is endemic? It's FAR less predictable and stable than covid."

u1465026528429981706,"@TWLadyGrey @toxchick42 @NumbersMuncher I understand Biden and Maddow and so on told you that you can't get covid if you're vaccinated, but you can - vaccination prevents serious illness.

u1465026528429981706,"@TWLadyGrey @NumbersMuncher Then again, people like you were mentally broken by being bombarded with silly, unhinged, messaging on covid.

u1465026528429981706,"@toxchick42 @TWLadyGrey @NumbersMuncher The epidemiological impact of vaccination on transmission is already very, very small; the relevance of under-12s vaccination is virtually non-existent.

u1465026528429981706,@TWLadyGrey @NumbersMuncher Kids have higher chances of dying from being eaten by a crocodile than from Covid. Sweden hasn't even authorized kids under 12 to be vaccinated. Absurd to think it matters in the least.

u1130959251671834624,‚Ä¶so resistance to one might mean resistance to all. We would therefore need to generate novel protease inhibitors that bind in different ways to protease so that they would still work even if COVID evolved resistance to 1st generation inhibitors like paxlovid.

u1130959251671834624,"For example, 2022 is the year we will see the benefits of direct oral anti-viral drugs, notably Pfizer‚Äôs COVID protease inhibitor Paxlovid. It targets the virus‚Äôs internal machinery, not the shape-changing external spike protein targeted by vaccines and antibodies."

u971676800,@HughCasswell You are asked when you go to your vaccine appointment if you have had covid within the last few weeks. One reason for younger adults eg students currently delaying vaccination is recently having had Covid.
u971676800,Covid passports &amp; compulsory vaccination of students raise a host of moral &amp; political concerns incl making access to higher education conditional on particular medical interventions &amp; will impact disproportionately particular groups. Persuasion rather than compulsion better.
